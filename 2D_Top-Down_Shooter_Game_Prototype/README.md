# Final Year Individual Computing Project Files

**:Created 08/04/22:**

### --- This project was developed in C# on Unity ---

- This folder contains the Prototype 2D Top-down Shooter game created for my final year project.

- The 'Assets' folder is the most important folder in the entire project as it contains all of the game's main code, namely the folders '***GameCode***' and '***AstarPathfindingProject***'. **\*These two should be sufficient for showcasing this project\***.
