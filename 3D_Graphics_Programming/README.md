# 3D Graphics Programming Project Files

### --- This project was developed in C++ on Visual Studio and a PS4 Devkit ---

- This directory contains 12 files of code in total: 1 C++ Source File (.cpp) and 11 Header Files (.h).

- These are only the files that I created and worked on, those that were provided in the module to help me get started are not included.

- Lines with `\\REDACTED` had code specific to communicating with Sony's PS4 Devkit. In compliance with Northumbria University's legal agreement with Sony, these lines **had** to be removed.

- A personal reflection on the project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12H67EoolEtrv6s5NzTj88QsKMh3ZOO2qdSuPU9SqVvk/edit?usp=sharing
