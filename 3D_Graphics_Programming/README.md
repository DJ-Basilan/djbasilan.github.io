# 3D Graphics Programming Project Files

**:Created 04/04/22:**

- Contains 12 files of code in total: 1 C++ Source File (.cpp) and 11 Header Files (.h).

- These are only the files that I created and worked on, those that were provided in the module to help me get started are not included.

- Lines with `\\REDACTED` had code specific to communicating with Sony's PS4 Devkit. In compliance with Northumbria University's legal agreement with Sony, these lines **had** to be removed.

- All files are 100% expected to ***NOT*** run whatsoever, its purpose is to showcase my knowledge of the C++ language.
